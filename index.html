      <p>The right of the planter to his Negroe is only founded  on the acts of his provincial assembly, and beyond their jurisdiction he has no power over him.</p>
      <p>If he teaches his Negroe to read one book, he will of himself read another, and such has been the imprudence of some illformed writers, that books are not wanting to exhort the Negroes to rebel against their masters.</p>
      <p>Were the Negroes universally taught to read, and a late publication, which out of respect I forbear to name, put into their hands and circulated among them, there would be little doubt that the next ships informed us of a general insurrection of the Negroes, and the massacre of their owners;</p>
      <p>and yet the writer's intention was certainly to engage the planter to have his Negroes instructed.</p>
